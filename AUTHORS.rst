Many thanks go to the creator and contributors of flake8_.
Which inspired me to write this hack on
top of flake8_ to be able to check jupyter notebooks for style violations as I do for years
with flake8_ on normal python files.

This packages skeleton was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template.

The idea to use cell tags was inspired by the use of cell tags in nbval_.
